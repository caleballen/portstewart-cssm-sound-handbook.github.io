## All you need to know 

### Equipment you'll need:
- 2x Speakers
- the desk
- 3x power cables
- 2x long XLR Cables (3 pinned)
- 2x Radio Mic Kit
    - a headset mic
    - a transmitter pack
    - a receiver unit
    - receiver unit power adapter
    - short jack cable
    - Europe to UK plug adapter

### Speaker Setup:
1. Unpack each speaker and power cable and place it where you want. The edges of the stage are a good location.
2. Connect the power cables to the back of each speaker and plug it in to a plug or extension lead.
3. Plug an XLR (3 pin) cable into the back of the speaker in the port labeled **INPUT 1**. It can only go in one way up and only one end will fit into the speaker! Make sure this cable is long enough to run to where you want the desk.
4. Set the knobs on the back of the speaker:
- **INPUT 1** should be a third up - roughly pointing towards the word LINE. This is the speaker power and we do not need all of it!
- **INPUT 2** should be all the way down as there's nothing plugged into it.
- **EQUALIZER** should be set to 0 on both HIGH and LOW - this means treble and bass sound neutral.

### Desk Setup:
1. Unpack the mixer and its power cable.
2. Connect the power cable to the back of the mixer and plug it in.
3. Plug the XLR cables connected to the speakers into the desk. Plug the right speaker (looking at the stage from the audience) into the **MAIN OUTPUTS R** and the left speaker into the **MAIN OUTPUTS L**. Mixing these up just means sound comes out the opposite speaker (but it will work)!

### Mic and Music Setup
1. Open the radio mic box and take out the receiver unit. Place it somewhere near the desk.
2. Plug the power cable into the receiver unit and the plug into the EU adapter. Plug that into an extension cable or wall plug.
3. Plug the short jack cable into the receiver unit and then into Channel 1's **LINE IN** input.
4. Unbox the transmitter pack. Take out the headset mic and carefully screw the headset mic plug into the transmitter pack input.
5. Repeat 1-4 for the second radio mic. Note that each transmitter pack is bound to a receiver unit, they are not swappable and do not interfere.
6. Take the Stereo AUX Cable and plug it into Channel 5/6. The white jack plugs into **L** and the red jack into **R**.

### Start it up!
1. Turn on the power for the desk using the switch on the back at the right hand side labelled **POWER ON**. An amber light should appear on the front.
2. Turn on the power for the speakers using the switch on the back labeled **POWER**. An amber light should appear on the back of each.
3. Turn on the receiver units. A red power LED should be shown on the front.

### Testing
#### Desk and speakers
1. Ensure the MAIN MIX button in the **SOURCE** box is depressed.
2. Plug your phone into the stereo AUX cable. Ensure the volume on your phone is up.
3. Start playing some music.
4. Turn the **MAIN MIX** sliders up to zero.
5. Move the **5/6** slider up.
6. The **L-R** LEDs should be lighting up and sound should be playing.
#### Mics
1. Turn on the transmitter pack, the receiver unit **RF** LED should light up amber.
2. Speak into the headset mic, the **AUDIO** LED should light up green.
3. Turn up the mic's channel slider on the desk, the **L-R** LEDs should be lighting up and voice should be playing.
4. You may need to adjust the **VOLUME** setting on the Receiver Unit and/or the channel's **GAIN** knob on the desk. Turn the **VOLUME** all the way up on the Receiver Unit and the **GAIN** knob to the lowest required.

### Basic Operation:
1. Ensure MAIN MIX slider is up.
2. Have someone speak into each MIC. For each adjust the MIC channel volume slider towards zero and then the gain to get the volume you want. Use the mute buttons and sliders to mute when not in use.
3. For music use channels 5/6 or 7/8 and use the volume slider to adjust to the desired volume.

## Guide
### The desk crash course
- The desk is split into vertical channels numbered **1-4** then **5/6** and **7/8**. Each channel has an input, settings and a volume slider.
- On the right the **MAIN MIX** is the master volume, it's the output volume to the speakers.
- From the top of the channel to the bottom you have
    - **COMP** (light blue) - Compressor: you can and often should ignore this but it reduces peaks in volume, "compressing" it.
    - **EQ** 3x(BLUE): **HIGH**, **MID** and **LOW**, adjusting these adjusts treble, mids and bass, you can turn each up or down.
    - **AUX**: you don't need this
    - **PAN**: moves the sound on side or the other. Panning left sends the sound out the left speaker and vice versa.

## Troubleshooting
### Work backwards
1. Is the desk outputting something? Test with your phone in AUX. Is the **MAIN MIX** up and LEDs lighting up? If so the issue lies with the speakers.

## Extra nerdy stuff

### Specifications

### Settings reset
You might want to do this if you're not sure what's going on and want a blank slate

For each channel set:
- the GAIN knob (black) to the lowest (turn up if more volume is needed)
- the COMP knob (light blue) to the lowest
- the 3 EQ knobs (dark blue) to the middle
- the AUX knobs (red and orange) to the lowest
- the PAN knob (black) to the middle
- ensure channel is not muted (MUTE LED off)
- volume slider to lowest (then turn up as needed)

On the right hand side
- AUX SENDS and STEREO AUX RETURNS are not used
- 2-TR/USB up
- ALT 3-4 up
- MAIN MIX pressed
- 2-TR/USB TO MAIN pressed
